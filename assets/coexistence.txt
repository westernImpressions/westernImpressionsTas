“共存 - Coexistence”
Linocut, hand-carved
2025

In Macquarie Harbour, an endangered Maugean skate drifts quietly through the same waters where salmon farming thrives.
Two species; one wild and rare, one cultivated and widespread. They share the same waterway, yet carry very different stories as most of you are aware.

I carved this piece thinking about 공존, the Korean word for “coexistence.”
But I chose to engrave it not in Hangul (the Korean alphabet), but in Hanja (Chinese characters) —
because those characters carry not just meaning, but a structure of thought rooted in East Asian philosophy.

As someone who once studied classical Chinese characters quite deeply,
I naturally came into contact with philosophies like Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism.
Those ideas didn’t feel foreign — they helped me see the world not as a set of boundaries,
but as a web of relationships. That’s why I chose to carve those ideas into this piece.

In that worldview, nature isn’t something outside of us.
We are part of it — and so are our technologies, our industries, and our choices.
They are not inherently unnatural.
What matters is whether we live with respect, balance, and responsibility.

This idea echoes across traditions:
• In Taoism, harmony comes not through control, but through wu wei — flowing with the natural order.
• In Buddhism, all things arise through interdependence (pratītyasamutpāda).
• In Confucianism, ethics is rooted in 仁 (in) — a care for life that grows from relationship.

This piece visualizes that tension —
between survival and sustainability,
between judgment and understanding,
between light and shadow,
Yin and Yang.
Yet they swim together.

The salmon is carved with dark dots in a light body,
the skate with light dots in a dark space.
One absorbs light; one reflects it.
They exist in contrast — but together. 

That’s 共存.
